# üìÑ‚¨ÖÔ∏èüëÄ `README.1ST`
I mostly contribute to open-source projects and sometimes squash bugs.

I also do experiments (also known as "unfinished projects"); they are mostly private (such as twonfi/test) but the public sandbox for things that need to be public for whatever reason are in twonfi/pubtest.

## What I'm working on
(Actual projects, guaranteed to be released.)
* Blender auto-updater with a lot of regex (couldn't find an actual update API)
* SteelSeries GameSense library

## What I contribute to
* **[Indie Wiki Buddy](https://github.com/KevinPayravi/indie-wiki-buddy)**: A browser extension to help people discover independent / community-friendly alternatives to Fandom, Fextralife and Neoseeker wikis
  * Add wikis and respond to issues

### Other (non-code) free projects
I love free content!

* Wikis
  * **Wikimedia**: Wikis like Wikipedia and Wikimedia Commons
    * Just take a look at [my English Wikipedia user page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/User:2NumForIce)
  * **NIWA**: Nintendo indie wikis (Bulbapedia, SmashWiki)
    * Because I hate Fandom‚Ñ¢

## Contact
### Before you get my email address...
- I am not available for hire; job-related emails will be ignored.
- Please don't spam (although spammers will ignore this anyway...)
  - Just don't make me buy a new domain just to change my email; my voicemail is scam-filled already, so don't ruin it even more.
- If it's about a project I'm working on, it's best to leave a comment _in public_. Collaboration works best that way.

My email address is:
```
// PASTE THE ENTIRE CODE BLOCK INTO A JAVASCRIPT CONSOLE (anti-spam)
// (just string concatenation; read over the code)
// (get one by pressing F12 and clicking the "Console" tab)
// it might warn you; again, just string concatenation

const eml = 'tnm.orug@gw.0c161712-6e4a-43d6-8f8b-c8f3df27a60c.xyz'
console.log(eml[0]+eml[10]+eml[4]+eml[8]+eml[0]+eml[10]+eml[4]+eml[1]+eml[6]+eml[2]+eml[3]+eml[4]+eml[5]+eml[7])
```
