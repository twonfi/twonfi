# üìÑ‚¨ÖÔ∏èüëÄ `README.1ST`
I mostly contribute to open-source projects and sometimes squash bugs.

I also do experiments (also known as "unfinished projects"); they are mostly private (such as twonfi/test) but the public sandbox for things that need to be public for whatever reason are in twonfi/pubtest.

## What I'm working on
(Actual projects, guaranteed to be released.)
* Blender auto-updater with a lot of regex (couldn't find an actual update API)
* SteelSeries GameSense library

## What I contribute to
* **[Indie Wiki Buddy](https://github.com/KevinPayravi/indie-wiki-buddy)**: A browser extension to help people discover independent / community-friendly alternatives to Fandom, Fextralife and Neoseeker wikis
  * Add wikis and respond to issues

## My languages
My usual programming languages (order not very significant):
* **Python**: It's easy to use, powerful, has an active community, and my first programming language other than Scratch.
* **JavaScript/TypeScript**: They're all [ECMAScripts](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ECMAScript), used a lot on the World Wide Web, and large communities.
* **Swift**: Getting into Apple app development, as well as being "inspired" by Python, but as a compiled language.
* **C(++/#)**: Also getting into Windows development.
* ~~HTML~~: HTML. Is. Not. A. _Programming_. Language. _(sorry.)_ HTML is a _markup language_, which is what the "ML" part stands for. Also not "machine learning".

English is my preferred human language.
