# Public keys
## GnuPG
My commits are signed with GnuPG. This is set as my _signing key_ on my main systems.

The public keys are stored in `gpg/github-<system>.pub.asc`.

## SSH
I almost always Git through SSH as it's more verifiable and secure. This is set as my _authentication key_ on my main systems.

The public keys are stored in `ssh/github-<system>_<type>.pub`.

## Systems

## Vigilant mode
This account has [vigilant mode](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification/displaying-verification-statuses-for-all-of-your-commits) enabled, meaning that if a commit is not signed, it will have a yellow `(Unverified)` badge.

* **Commits before 2024-10-09: 游릭 Trust** They have been unverified due to username change.
* **Other commits: 游댮 Don't trust**
